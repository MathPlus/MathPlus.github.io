This repository holds the source code for my personal professional website math.GillesGnacadja.info. I started it as a fork off of the [GitHub Pages] (https://pages.github.com/ "GitHub Pages") template [AcademicPages.GitHub.io] (https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io "AcademicPages"). I then committed many sins. For instance, I did not honor the great principle of separation of data and presentation. Indeed, I embedded a lot of HTML code in Markdown files. Also, much of that HTML code is repetitive and could be generated, but instead I copied-pasted-edited a lot. There certainly are many more sins, as this is my first use of Jekyll. Time permitting I will improve all of that. (Hum.... Really? We will see about that.)
